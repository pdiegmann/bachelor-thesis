While it has become easy to develop a mobile health (mHealth) application (app), there is much more to it than just the aspects of the app's core functionality. Currently only very few guidelines, best practices and systematic development approaches for mobile app development can be found. And even less can be found for the specific area of mHealth apps.
\\
\\
Security leaks or even abuse of private and sensitive information can lead to great harm for the app user and to legal issues for the developer. Abuse of personal health related information can result in loss of reputation (e.g. sexual transmitted diseases) or financial drawbacks and decreased chances of employment (e.g. chronic diseases, genetic dispositions)\footnote{cf. \cite{Dehling.2013}, pp. 6-7}. With poorly developed apps, there is a chance of security leaks and hence for data abuse. Thus the risk for app users increases. A study\footnote{cf. \cite{Njie.2013}, pp. 19-20} has shown that only very few mHealth apps entail little or low risk for the app user. Self-publishing through modern sales channels like Google Play (http://play.google.com) or the iOS App Store (http://appstore.com) and the availability of easy-to-use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) lower the barriers for entry. Even one-man developers or small teams are now able to publish easily apps with little development effort. Without fundamental knowledge of privacy and security aspects, there is an increase in the non-professional development of mobile apps with inadequate security aspects.
\\
\\
The usability, especially in critical situations, is another undervalued aspect in many non-professional developments. While fancy colors might look appealing to the developer himself, it might lead to confusion for the app user or even to a lack of operability for visually impaired people.\footnote{cf. \cite{Badashian.2008} p. 108} Also the need for a intuitive user interface might not be considered as important as it should be.
\\
\\
Knowledge of data privacy acts and laws is a premise for a legal, safe and fair development for the developer and the app user. Multiple layers of data privacy laws in Europe on international, national and state level require a certain legal knowledge.\footnote{cf. Directive 95/46 of the European Parliament and of the Council (October, 24th 1995), Directive 2002/58 of the European Parliament and of the Council (July, 12th 2002) cited by \cite{FutureofPrivacyForumCenterforDemocracy&Technology.2011}, p. 16} Also the benefit of and the need for a privacy policy seems to be ambiguous for many non-professional developers.\footnote{cf. \cite{Njie.2013}, p. 20}
\\
\\
This lack of guidelines for mobile app development and of specific guidelines for privacy and usability sensitive apps is only superficially considered by most of the literature. The beforehand highlighted aspects of usability and information security are just two of multiple possible requirements. Current research seems not to state which specific requirements, if any, distinguish mHealth apps from other apps or which are needed to be more accented.

\subsection{Objectives of this Thesis}
\todo{Revise!}
\\
The purpose of this thesis is to discover, identify and report issues and challenges of the development of mHealth apps by developing a mobile frontend for the ePill system (developed by the University of Cologne, http://epill.uni-koeln.de). ePill is a patient-centered health IT service which offers information on pharmaceuticals and aggregation of pharmaceutical data in context.
\\
\\
During the development of a mobile frontend for ePill, all requirements can be addressed more easily than in a completely theoretical context. As a side effect, a mobile app for ePill will increase the accessibility for the ePill system in general and thereby increase the possible user value. Especially in critical situations in which one does not have one's desktop computer at hand, a mobile easy-to-use app can be of value.
\\
\\
The experiences made during the development refer to general mobile app development, but also to the specific development of mHealth apps.
\\
Mainly this thesis aims to describe the planning and the development process and discuss all discovered issues and challenges for planning and developing mHealth apps. One sub-objective is to give a short overview about the state of research on guidelines and important factors of mHealth app development. Subsequently, this thesis aims to highlight specific characteristics of mHealth apps and focus on them during the development as well in the conclusion. \todo{Revise last sentence}
