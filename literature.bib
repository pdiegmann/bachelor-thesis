 abstract = {The extensible Markup Language (XML) has wide usage in healthcare to facilitate health information exchange via the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) for storing/managing patient data, diagnoses, medical notes, tests, scans, etc. Health IT products like electronic health record (EHR, e.g., GE Centricity) and personal health record (PHR, e.g., MS Health Vault) use CCR for data representation. To manage patient data in CCR, security as governed by HTPAA must be attained when using XML and its technologies (XACML, XSLT, etc.). Our objective is to have an XML document (CCR instance) appear differently to authorized users at different times based on a user's role, constraints, separation of duty, delegation of authority, etc. In this paper, we propose a security framework that targets XML sch{\'e}mas and documents, in general, and CCR sch{\'e}mas and documents, in particular with control capabilities that achieve customizable access to an XML document's elements by applying secure software engineering methodologies and defining new UML XML-focused diagrams for sch{\'e}mas and permissions. This allows us to generate XACML policies, and enforce security at the runtime level on XML instances to insure that correct and required patient data is securely delivered. In a market of rapidly emerging mobile healthcare applications to allow patients to manage their own data (PHRs) and for self-management of chronic diseases, the need for secure access to information and its authorization and transmission to providers (and EHRs) will be critical.},

 abstract = {Background: Smartphones and tablet computers have become an integral part of our lives. One of their key features is the possibility of installing third-party apps. These apps can be very helpful for improving health and healthcare. However, medical professionals and citizens are currently being overloaded with health apps. Consequently, they will have difficulty with finding the right app, and information and features are fragmented over too many apps, thereby limiting their usefulness. Discussion: In order to combat health app overload, suppliers of apps need to do three things. One, join the open source movement, so that a few apps can work as gateway to medical information by incorporating information from different sources. Two, standardize content, so that the information provided via apps is readable. And third, in order to prevent information overload from occurring within an app, content should be personalized towards an individual's characteristics and context. Summary: Suppliers of medical information and features need to join the open source movement and must make use of standardized medical information formats, in order to allow third parties to create valuable, mobile gateway apps. This can prevent the occurrence of health app overload. By going along in these trends, we can make health apps achieve the impact on healthcare quality and citizens' health many of us envision.},

 abstract = {Privacy requirements for mobile applications offer a distinct set of challenges for requirements engineering. First, they are highly dynamic, changing over time and locations, and across the different roles of agents involved and the kinds of information that may be disclosed. Second, although some general privacy requirements can be elicited a priori, users often refine them at runtime as they interact with the system and its environment. Selectively disclosing information to appropriate agents is therefore a key privacy management challenge, requiring carefully formulated privacy requirements amenable to systematic reasoning. In this paper, we introduce privacy arguments as a means of analysing privacy requirements in general and selective disclosure requirements (that are both content- and context-sensitive) in particular. Privacy arguments allow individual users to express personal preferences, which are then used to reason about privacy for each user under different contexts. At runtime, these arguments provide a way to reason about requirements satisfaction and diagnosis. Our proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated using the privacy requirements of BuddyTracker, a mobile application we developed as part of our overall research programme.},

The usability of mobile applications is critical for their adoption because of the relatively small screen and awkward (sometimes virtual) keyboard, despite the recent advances of smartphones. Traditional laboratory-based usability testing is often tedious, expensive, and does not reflect real use cases. In this paper, we propose a toolkit that embeds into mobile applications the ability to automatically collect user interface (UI) events as the user interacts with the applications. The events are fine-grained and useful for quantified usability analysis. We have implemented the toolkit on Android devices and we evaluated the toolkit with a real deployed Android application by comparing event analysis (state-machine based) with traditional laboratory testing (expert based). The results show that our toolkit is effective at capturing detailed UI events for accurate usability analysis.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We consider a need for interfaces which automatically adapt their interaction and presentation capabilities on the user?s situational needs and expectations to decrease the complexity of the environment and increase the usability of the system. Therefore, a rule-set is required which gives knowledge on the mobile interface?s adaptations as a consequence on a user?s situations within the environment. This rule-set iteratively emerges within a user-centred development process by considering and testing each contextual situation of the user when interacting with the mobile interface. In this paper we describe an approach of a usage model for specifying each context of the user and the environment as well as the user?s goals and mental model. Moreover, we describe our used user-centred process to develop the usage model and rule-set, practical experience in development of mobile interfaces, some guidelines and our planned future work.},

However, in many software development projects, sustainability is treated as an afterthought, as developers are driven by time-to-market pressure and are often not educated to apply sustainability-improving techniques. While software engineering research and practice has suggested a large amount of such techniques, a holistic overview is missing and the effectiveness of individual techniques is often not sufficiently validated. On this behalf we created a catalog of ``software sustainability guidelines'' to support project managers, software architects, and developers during system design, development, operation, and maintenance. This paper describes how we derived these guidelines and how we applied selected techniques from them in two industrial case studies.

The focus of the study was on investigating the willingness of users to accept medical technology in their homes and the specific conditions under which continuous monitoring would be acceptable. Using the questionnaire method, a total of 165 users (17-95 years) were examined regarding privacy, intimacy and trust issues for medical technology in homes. The results highlight trust and privacy as central requirements, especially when implemented within private spaces. The reported concerns were mostly insensitive to gender and age. Overall, it was revealed that acceptance issues and users' needs and wants should be seriously considered in order to successfully design new medical technologies.},

 abstract = {Efficient programs are characterized by several parameters including the User Interface Design (UID). From the end-user's point of view, the user interface is the representative of the program. Therefore, friendlier software with limited capabilities is viewed to be more useable than a comprehensive software; in other words, the UI has a great impact on the software to choose. There has been a great amount of work on UID guidelines. In this paper, we introduce the fundamental guidelines that a designer should consider to increase usability. We consider new aspects including user access, language selection and other technical options in the forms.The subjects are studied independently from the application and are applicable to all kinds of environments such as web based, desktop, and embedded software. Following these guidelines results in a software which is friendlier, easier to understand and use, more reusable and less tedious.},

@article{MartinezPerez.2013,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: New possibilities for mHealth have arisen by means of the latest advances in mobile communications and technologies. With more than 1 billion smartphones and 100 million tablets around the world, these devices can be a valuable tool in health care management. Every aid for health care is welcome and necessary as shown by the more than 50 million estimated deaths caused by illnesses or health conditions in 2008. Some of these conditions have additional importance depending on their prevalence.
OBJECTIVE: To study the existing applications for mobile devices exclusively dedicated to the eight most prevalent health conditions by the latest update (2004) of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) of the World Health Organization (WHO): iron-deficiency anemia, hearing loss, migraine, low vision, asthma, diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis (OA), and unipolar depressive disorders.
METHODS: Two reviews have been carried out. The first one is a review of mobile applications in published articles retrieved from the following systems: IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Knowledge, and PubMed. The second review is carried out by searching the most important commercial app stores: Google play, iTunes, BlackBerry World, Windows Phone Apps+Games, and Nokia's Ovi store. Finally, two applications for each condition, one for each review, were selected for an in-depth analysis.
RESULTS: Search queries up to April 2013 located 247 papers and more than 3673 apps related to the most prevalent conditions. The conditions in descending order by the number of applications found in literature are diabetes, asthma, depression, hearing loss, low vision, OA, anemia, and migraine. However when ordered by the number of commercial apps found, the list is diabetes, depression, migraine, asthma, low vision, hearing loss, OA, and anemia. Excluding OA from the former list, the four most prevalent conditions have fewer apps and research than the final four. Several results are extracted from the in-depth analysis: most of the apps are designed for monitoring, assisting, or informing about the condition. Typically an Internet connection is not required, and most of the apps are aimed for the general public and for nonclinical use. The preferred type of data visualization is text followed by charts and pictures. Assistive and monitoring apps are shown to be frequently used, whereas informative and educational apps are only occasionally used.
CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of work on mobile applications is not equal for the eight most prevalent conditions. Whereas some conditions such as diabetes and depression have an overwhelming number of apps and research, there is a lack of apps related to other conditions, such as anemia, hearing loss, or low vision, which must be filled.},

 abstract = {The number of users using mobile handheld devices to access mobile websites has grown exponentially within a few years. However, the quality of mobile websites is poor and contributes to unsatisfying user experiences. The W3C's Mobile Web Best Practices are de facto standards to improve the quality of mobile websites. This paper examines the impact of the W3C Standards on delivering web content to mobile devices, as well as the impact of mobile usability on website design. As no prior research exists that aims to answer these questions, this paper will be extremely valuable to people who develop web standards, as well as to web engineers. In the context of web development, such answers are critical, since all other major aspects of the Internet are already standardized. With our assessment we explore the issues and challenges associated with W3C Mobile Web standards implementation, as well as suggestions for future research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The need for such an approach is given by the rapid growth in importance of both social networks and mobile applications. In order to make it easy to follow where the best practices come from, the paper starts with a look at why social networks are more than just a buzz word and at how the field of mobile applications is evolving. It also shows how and why the two fields go together so well. To further make the point, there is a case study of four interesting mobile applications that are textbooks examples of successful applications. The best practices are based on research done for this article and on the extensive knowledge of the author. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},
