 abstract = {The extensible Markup Language (XML) has wide usage in healthcare to facilitate health information exchange via the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) for storing/managing patient data, diagnoses, medical notes, tests, scans, etc. Health IT products like electronic health record (EHR, e.g., GE Centricity) and personal health record (PHR, e.g., MS Health Vault) use CCR for data representation. To manage patient data in CCR, security as governed by HTPAA must be attained when using XML and its technologies (XACML, XSLT, etc.). Our objective is to have an XML document (CCR instance) appear differently to authorized users at different times based on a user's role, constraints, separation of duty, delegation of authority, etc. In this paper, we propose a security framework that targets XML sch{\'e}mas and documents, in general, and CCR sch{\'e}mas and documents, in particular with control capabilities that achieve customizable access to an XML document's elements by applying secure software engineering methodologies and defining new UML XML-focused diagrams for sch{\'e}mas and permissions. This allows us to generate XACML policies, and enforce security at the runtime level on XML instances to insure that correct and required patient data is securely delivered. In a market of rapidly emerging mobile healthcare applications to allow patients to manage their own data (PHRs) and for self-management of chronic diseases, the need for secure access to information and its authorization and transmission to providers (and EHRs) will be critical.},

 abstract = {Background: Smartphones and tablet computers have become an integral part of our lives. One of their key features is the possibility of installing third-party apps. These apps can be very helpful for improving health and healthcare. However, medical professionals and citizens are currently being overloaded with health apps. Consequently, they will have difficulty with finding the right app, and information and features are fragmented over too many apps, thereby limiting their usefulness. Discussion: In order to combat health app overload, suppliers of apps need to do three things. One, join the open source movement, so that a few apps can work as gateway to medical information by incorporating information from different sources. Two, standardize content, so that the information provided via apps is readable. And third, in order to prevent information overload from occurring within an app, content should be personalized towards an individual's characteristics and context. Summary: Suppliers of medical information and features need to join the open source movement and must make use of standardized medical information formats, in order to allow third parties to create valuable, mobile gateway apps. This can prevent the occurrence of health app overload. By going along in these trends, we can make health apps achieve the impact on healthcare quality and citizens' health many of us envision.},

 abstract = {Privacy requirements for mobile applications offer a distinct set of challenges for requirements engineering. First, they are highly dynamic, changing over time and locations, and across the different roles of agents involved and the kinds of information that may be disclosed. Second, although some general privacy requirements can be elicited a priori, users often refine them at runtime as they interact with the system and its environment. Selectively disclosing information to appropriate agents is therefore a key privacy management challenge, requiring carefully formulated privacy requirements amenable to systematic reasoning. In this paper, we introduce privacy arguments as a means of analysing privacy requirements in general and selective disclosure requirements (that are both content- and context-sensitive) in particular. Privacy arguments allow individual users to express personal preferences, which are then used to reason about privacy for each user under different contexts. At runtime, these arguments provide a way to reason about requirements satisfaction and diagnosis. Our proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated using the privacy requirements of BuddyTracker, a mobile application we developed as part of our overall research programme.},

The usability of mobile applications is critical for their adoption because of the relatively small screen and awkward (sometimes virtual) keyboard, despite the recent advances of smartphones. Traditional laboratory-based usability testing is often tedious, expensive, and does not reflect real use cases. In this paper, we propose a toolkit that embeds into mobile applications the ability to automatically collect user interface (UI) events as the user interacts with the applications. The events are fine-grained and useful for quantified usability analysis. We have implemented the toolkit on Android devices and we evaluated the toolkit with a real deployed Android application by comparing event analysis (state-machine based) with traditional laboratory testing (expert based). The results show that our toolkit is effective at capturing detailed UI events for accurate usability analysis.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

We consider a need for interfaces which automatically adapt their interaction and presentation capabilities on the user?s situational needs and expectations to decrease the complexity of the environment and increase the usability of the system. Therefore, a rule-set is required which gives knowledge on the mobile interface?s adaptations as a consequence on a user?s situations within the environment. This rule-set iteratively emerges within a user-centred development process by considering and testing each contextual situation of the user when interacting with the mobile interface. In this paper we describe an approach of a usage model for specifying each context of the user and the environment as well as the user?s goals and mental model. Moreover, we describe our used user-centred process to develop the usage model and rule-set, practical experience in development of mobile interfaces, some guidelines and our planned future work.},

However, in many software development projects, sustainability is treated as an afterthought, as developers are driven by time-to-market pressure and are often not educated to apply sustainability-improving techniques. While software engineering research and practice has suggested a large amount of such techniques, a holistic overview is missing and the effectiveness of individual techniques is often not sufficiently validated. On this behalf we created a catalog of ``software sustainability guidelines'' to support project managers, software architects, and developers during system design, development, operation, and maintenance. This paper describes how we derived these guidelines and how we applied selected techniques from them in two industrial case studies. We report several lessons learned about sustainable software development.},

 abstract = {This paper reports on a study exploring the attitudes of users towards video-based monitoring systems for long-term care of elderly or disabled people in smart home environments. The focus of the study was on investigating the willingness of users to accept medical technology in their homes and the specific conditions under which continuous monitoring would be acceptable. Using the questionnaire method, a total of 165 users (17-95 years) were examined regarding privacy, intimacy and trust issues for medical technology in homes. The results highlight trust and privacy as central requirements, especially when implemented within private spaces. The reported concerns were mostly insensitive to gender and age. Overall, it was revealed that acceptance issues and users' needs and wants should be seriously considered in order to successfully design new medical technologies.},
